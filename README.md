# Sentiment classification, test task

This repository contains my test task solution. 
Model definition and all the comments are in the `NLP_sentiment.ipynb` file. 

## Local setup

- **Run**:

    1. Open the terminal and run:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/app1606/sentiment_test_task .
        jupyter lab
        ```
    
    However, I recommend to use [this](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VRjwCuUk80reWUk2OxZjosBrfpNEZcrD#scrollTo=QgTPpkaWhUXL) Colab link and try it there (I met some jupyter notebook problems while running locally)
